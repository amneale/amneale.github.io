A couple of years ago I gave a presentation about the 'new kid on the block' when it comes to web design layouts - flexbox.
The principles within remain valid, and useful, when understanding how flexbox works, and why it is useful to know about it.
Flexbox now has extremely good browser compatibility, and is starting to gain traction with major front-end frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/utilities/flexbox/) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-grid.html).
My presentation is now [available online](/flexbox), and the code itself is available on [github](https://github.com/amneale/flexbox).
